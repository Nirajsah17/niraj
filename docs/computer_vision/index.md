# Computer Vision


### Computer Vision üñºÔ∏è

The computer vision section explores techniques and technologies for enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. This area involves:

- **Image Processing:** Techniques for manipulating and analyzing images, including filtering, transformation, and feature extraction.
- **Object Detection & Recognition:** Methods for identifying and locating objects within images or video streams, utilizing algorithms like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN.
- **Image Classification:** Using machine learning models to classify images into categories, with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Feature Matching:** Techniques for finding corresponding features between images, useful in applications like panorama stitching and 3D reconstruction.
- **Deep Learning for Vision:** Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures to tackle complex vision tasks.
- **Applications:** Practical uses of computer vision in areas like augmented reality, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging.

This section includes hands-on projects, code implementations, and research papers that demonstrate the application of computer vision techniques in real-world scenarios.
